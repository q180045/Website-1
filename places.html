            <h1>Selby Abbey</h1>
            <p>Inspiring architecture; sacred space and a vibrant worshipping community make Selby Abbey the place it is
                today. Men, women and children have worshipped here and served the wider community for over 900 years.
                Selby is a small Yorkshire town, 12 miles South of York with one of the most superb Abbey churches to be
                found anywhere in England. The Abbey is not just a building it is a living and vibrant part of the local
                community yet provides space that allow the visitor and the worshipper alike to find peace, tranquillity
                and the very presence of God.</p>
