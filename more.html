                <h1>Governance</h1>
                <p>At the lowest level of governance is Selby Town Council. The town is divided into three electoral
                    wards,
                    north, south and west, each represented by six councillors. These 17 councillors are responsible for
                    burial grounds, allotments, play areas and some street lighting. Elections to the town council are
                    held
                    every four years. The Mayor of Selby is elected annually by the members of the town council.</p>

                <p>At district level the town is part of the Selby District Council area. The town is represented by
                    seven
                    councillors on the District Council, two each for the west and south wards and three for the north
                    ward. On the North Yorkshire County Council the town is part of the Selby Barlby county division
                    which elects two representatives to the county council. In the United Kingdom Parliament Selby
                    formed part of the Selby constituency until the 2010 general election when it became part of the new
                    seat of Selby and Ainsty. It is represented by Conservative MP, Nigel Adams.</p>

                <h1>Geography</h1>
                <p>Selby lies on the tidal River Ouse in a natural area of Yorkshire known as the Humberhead Levels. The
                    main roads which cross at Selby are the A63 from Leeds to Hull and the A19 from Doncaster to York,
                    though the A19 and A63 no longer meet in Selby itself since the opening of the Selby Bypass in 2004.
                    The
                    River Ouse is navigable upstream as far as York so the old toll bridge by which the A63 crossed the
                    river at Selby had to allow for this. For many years the swing bridge in Selby was a notorious local
                    bottleneck but since the opening of the Selby bypass congestion in the town has been relieved.</p>
                <p>The importance of Selby as a market town has declined in recent decades and its short lived
                    prominence as
                    the centre of the Selby Coalfield has also waned. Selby is close in proximity to both York and
                    Leeds.
                    Its popularity as a tourist destination, due to Selby Abbey, has led to a large amount of
                    development
                    and renovation in the town and surrounding area.</p>
                <p>The residential areas of Selby have also been subject to expansion and development. A significant
                    development called Staynor Hall continues to be developed on the South East of the town, with other
                    developments in the Holmes Lane area, and around the villages of Brayton, Barlby and Thorpe
                    Willoughby.
                    More have been built at various points along the riverfront, the result of an ongoing project to
                    improve
                    an area that had been largely derelict since the decline of the shipbuilding industry.</p>

            <div class="list">
                <h1>Religion</h1>
                <p>Selby Abbey is one of the largest parish churches in Britain and is larger than several cathedrals.
                </p>
                <p>There are various other Christian churches in the town that offer community and differing styles of
                    worship: King's Church, St Mary's Roman Catholic Church, Portholme Methodist / URC Church,
                    and St James' Church. Edge Community was founded in 2009 for the Flaxley Road community, and The
                    Salvation Army opened The Church at the Crossroads on the Abbotts Road estate in 2015.</p>
                <p>Brayton has St Wilfrid's Anglican Church and the Methodist Chapel and All Saints' Church is in
                    Barlby.
                </p>
                <p>Selby Churches Together set up and run the Selby and District Food Bank.</p>

            <div class="list">
                <h1>Transport</h1>
                <p>Selby is the transport hub for the local area and has a bus and railway station running services to
                    many
                    places around the area. Train services from Selby railway station run directly to London King's
                    Cross,
                    Leeds, Manchester Piccadilly, York, Hull and other destinations. Arriva Yorkshire have a bus depot
                    in
                    Selby, from where they offer a range of local services, as well as longer services to Goole,
                    Doncaster,
                    Leeds, Pontefract, Wakefield and York. Thornes Independent of Hemingbrough also offer a range of
                    services in the area.</p>
                <p>In July 2001 construction began on the Selby bypass which was authorised for development in 1993. The
                    bypass runs from the A19 at Barlby along the southern perimeter of Selby, joining the A63 at Thorpe
                    Willoughby. The project was delayed due to technical difficulties with the swing bridge over the
                    River
                    Ouse but was eventually completed in July 2004.</p>

                <h1>Hobson murders</h1>
                <p>Selby and its surrounding area came to national prominence, once again, through another tragedy on 18
                    July 2004, this time through four exceptionally violent murders carried out by former refuse
                    collector
                    Mark Hobson. Hobson, 34 at the time, killed his girlfriend Claire Sanderson, 27, and her sister
                    Diane at
                    a flat in the nearby village of Camblesforth. He subsequently murdered an elderly couple, James and
                    Joan
                    Britton, at their home in the village of Strensall, near York. Hobson was later sentenced to life
                    imprisonment with the trial judge recommending that he should never be released; the High Court
                    later
                    agreed with this recommendation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="list">
                <h1>Rail crash</h1>
                <p>The 2001 Great Heck rail crash is also often referred to as the Selby rail crash. It happened a few
                    miles
                    south of Selby, at the village of Great Heck near the M62 motorway, and Selby was the closest major
                    town
                    to the accident site. On 28 February 2001, a vehicle crashed off the M62 down an embankment on to a
                    railway track, where it was struck by a passenger train heading to London. The accident was then
                    compounded by a second collision involving an oncoming goods train.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="list">
                <h1>Culture and sport</h1>
                <p>Selby Town Hall has been running a music venue since 2003, with regular performances of music, dance,
                    drama and comedy and local band nights, with an annual Battle Of The Bands final, which in 2009 sold
                    out in 12 hours, seeing local band Leonard's Revenge crowned victors.</p>
                <p>There have been four cinemas in Selby with the last one closing in the early 1980s. In 2009 a
                    community
                    group established a cinema project called Selby Globe. The group are also working with local
                    community
                    groups in securing the Abbot's Staith, a 15th-century warehouse, a property currently on English
                    Heritage's At Risk Register, it is anticipated that the development of the Abbot's Staith could
                    offer
                    opportunities for social, educational, historical and economic solutions for the town, whilst also
                    promoting tourism.</p>
                <p>Selby's major sporting team is Selby Town F.C. ('the Robins'), playing in the Northern Counties East
                    Division One and based at the Flaxley Road Stadium. As a result of a sponsorship deal by a local
                    business, the stadium is now known as the "Fairfax Plant Hire Stadium". The club was founded in
                    1919, and their most successful season was perhaps the 1953/54 season when they won the Yorkshire
                    Football League and reached the 1st Round of the FA Cup – meeting Bradford Park Avenue and getting
                    their
                    highest ever attendance of 7,000 fans.</p>
                <p>A Rugby union club, Selby RUFC, is based at Sandhill Lane Stadium. Sandhill Lane Stadium is currently
                    undergoing construction work to create a new seating stand overlooking the first team pitch, as well
                    as
                    a gym and new changing rooms being added to the members' bar and club bar that's already in place.
                    Selby
                    RUFC have five open age teams, and have veteran and junior set-ups too. Selby 1st are currently in
                    Yorkshire League Division One. In the season 2008–09 Selby U10s won the Gullivers Plate down at
                    Twickenham, The U16s got to the final of the Yorkshire Bowl and Selby 3rds also reached a North
                    Yorkshire final. Selby also has a rugby league club, Selby Warriors based at The Rigid Containers
                    Sports
                    Ground, Foxhill Lane and the Selby Rugby League Referees Society.</p>
                <p>Selby Cricket Club which shares Sandhill Lane Stadium has four senior league teams, with the 1st and
                    2nd
                    XI playing in the York and District Senior League, the 1st XI in Division 4 and the 2nd XI in

                    5. Also the 3rd XI play in Division 4 and 4th XI play in Division 5 of the York Vale League. The
                    team
                    runs two junior teams the under 11s and 15s which both play in the York and District Junior League
                    and
                    also an evening league team in the Howdenshire Evening League (West Division).</p>
                <p>Selby and District Motor Club has its own clubhouse at Breighton Airfield on Sand Lane. Meeting on
                    Tuesday evenings, its members participate in Road Rallies, Stage Rallies, Sprints, Autotests and
                    Production Car Trials. Members discuss motor sporting events and regularly show videos. The club has
                    organised an annual Road Rally called the Three Swans Rally, based on local roads and forming a
                    major
                    part of local championships.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="list">
                <h1>Economy</h1>
                <p>Much of the historical wealth of the town is based upon its position upon the banks of the tidal
                    River
                    Ouse. In the past, Selby had a large shipbuilding industry and was an important port, due to the
                    Selby
                    Canal which brought trade from Leeds. The Selby Canal links the River Ouse at Selby, to the River
                    Aire
                    at Haddlesey. The replacement Greenpeace craft (1989 – 2011), bearing the name Rainbow Warrior was
                    built in Selby in 1957 as a fishing boat.</p>
                <p>For a time, Selby was the leading coal mining area in the UK and featured some of the most advanced
                    mining technology in Europe. It was the first new mine in the UK for decades and seen as a rejoinder
                    to
                    widespread concern that the British mining industry was effectively shutting down, particularly
                    following the defeat of the 1984–85 miners' strike.</p>
                <p>Wistow Colliery, which was part of the Selby Coalfield, holds the UK record for coal mined in one
                    week—200,743 tonnes in 1995. The 110 square miles (280 km2) Selby Complex, employing 3,000 miners
                    plus
                    contractors and ancillary staff, closed on Friday 14 May 2004 despite rising demand for coal in the
                    UK.
                    UK Coal, the pit's owner, said closure was due to rising costs caused by deteriorating geological
                    conditions and the falling price of coal. In its final years, the company listed a £30 million loss
                    on
                    the plant.
                </p>
                <p>Although much of the infrastructure of the shipbuilding and coal mining industries remain both in and
                    around Selby, both industries have long since been defunct. Present day, the main income for the
                    area is
                    derived from arable farming and as a commuter area for Leeds, Wakefield and York.</p>
                <p>In recent years, Selby has seen the development of new shopping areas both in the town centre and on
                    the
                    outskirts. The Abbey Walk Shopping Centre was developed on recreational land that runs parallel to
                    the
                    town centre. The expansion not only increased the volume of town centre shops but also provided
                    large
                    scale, convenient parking for the town centre. In more recent years, the Three Lakes Retail Park has
                    opened on the outskirts of town and continues to expand with more developments under construction.
                    Two of the town's supermarkets, Tesco and Morrisons are both looking to expand their stores, the
                    latter
                    meaning the re-siting of the Abbey Primary School.</p>
                <p>On 14 September 2005, Selby District Council was conditionally granted outline planning permission
                    for a
                    state of the art science facility to be built on the site of Burn Gliding Club but these plans did
                    not
                    come to fruition.</p>
