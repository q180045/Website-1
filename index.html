            <h1>One of Yorkshire’s hidden gems</h1>
            <p>The historic market town of Selby is home to the stunning Abbey and so much more. From Vikings and
                Romans to royal births and dissolution, from fire and floods to ship building and thriving industries,
                the resilient town of Selby has witnessed it all.</p>
            <p>Much of the historical wealth of the town is based upon its position upon the banks of the tidal River
                Ouse. In the past, Selby had a large shipbuilding industry and was an important port, due to the Selby
                Canal which brought trade from Leeds.</p>

            <h1>This is Selby!</h1>
            <p class="multiple">Today, you can take a tour around Selby, following one of the heritage themed walks
                available, explore
                the historical streets surrounding the Abbey, taking in an array of small, independent shops and places
                to eat, or visit the traditional weekly market. Running through the heart of the town, the High Street
                is also home to several well-known brands and High Street names. </p>

            <p class="multiple">Overflowing with heritage and culture, the jewel in the district’s crown is the great
                Norman Selby
                Abbey, founded under William the Conqueror by Royal Charter. The history of Selby, and in particular the
                founding of Selby Abbey, is full of rich and marvellous tales involving visions, saints and great
                travels. See the stunning icon of St Germain, newly commissioned to celebrate 950 years since the
                Abbey’s founding. Discover the Washington Window, with its links to the modern day American flag, or
                follow the Benedict Trail, designed to help families uncover lots of interesting and quirky features.
            </p>

            <p class="multiple">Selby Park offers five acres of space to explore right in the heart of the town and you
                can play a quick
                round of mini golf, while away an afternoon in the pavilion and sample the local, legendary Doubtfire’s
                ice-cream.</p>

            <p class="multiple"> Enjoy a creative activity with family and friends, or treat yourself to some
                well-deserved relaxation on
                your own, at Selby’s new pottery painting studio, The Painting Pot. It’s fun, it’s easy and a fantastic
                place to relax.</p>

            <p class="multiple"> Selby also has a diverse cultural offer. Selby Town Hall is a uniquely intimate
                performing arts centre
                based in a 150 year old former Primitive Methodist Church. It has developed a strong reputation for its
                programme of consistently high quality national and international touring artists from the worlds of
                comedy, folk, theatre, blues, pop, rock, Americana and more.</p>

            <p>Foodies love Selby Food Festival held each July, with cookery demonstrations and street performances,
                providing entertainment for the whole family.</p>
